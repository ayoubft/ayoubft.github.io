Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Ayoub here, always exploring and learning.

As part of my PhD journey, I am diving into cutting-edge technologies. My research focuses on capturing geological puzzles, particularly fractures, using drones and LiDAR, and developing automated detection methods.

My areas of expertise and research interests include:

* Remote sensing: including hyperspectral imaging, object detection and 3D reconstruction
* Machine learning and deep learning: for geo-spatial and medical applications
* Computing: high-performance computing
* Software engineering: open-source and Python

I also have a deep passion for the cosmos. As an astronomy enthusiast, I often find myself gazing at the stars, eager to unravel the mysteries of the universe.

Beyond my technical pursuits, Iâ€™m always ready to lend a helping hand, collaborate on exciting projects, share knowledge, or contribute to meaningful initiatives. Iâ€™m here to make a positive impact wherever possible.
